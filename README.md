kinect-theremin
===============

A theremin-esque "musical instrument" powered by [NAudio] (http://naudio.codeplex.com/) and the Microsoft Kinect.    

Uses [WpfKinectHelper] (https://github.com/bencentra/WpfKinectHelper) for interfacing with the Kinect. 

Made by [Ben Centra](https://github.com/bencentra). Based on an earlier project, [naudio-sinegen] (https://github.com/bencentra/naudio-sinegen).
